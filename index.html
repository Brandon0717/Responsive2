                                <p>Wolf is a symbol of guardianship, ritual, loyalty, and spirit. Wolf has the ability to make quick and firm emotional attachments, and often need to trust their own instincts. Thus they teach us to do the same, to trust our hearts and minds, and have control over our own lives.</p>

                                    <p>I am a very hard working person, I don't mind working for a long time span. I started working at a young age which built my endurandce up on working in most environments, if there is any job opportunities that are offered to me i take them because i like having new experiences and helping out anyone. If any of my family or friends needed someone to help them fix around there household or even work in food vending they ask me because i have enough experience to start up there process.</p>
